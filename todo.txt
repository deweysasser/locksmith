TODO

* Add a docker build file
* Create github release process

* test on MacOS
* sanity check on Linux
* "find" things by filtering on not top level
* implement "recursive connect" for SSH (i.e. sudo)
* implement "recursive connect" for AWS (i.e. SSH to all of the
  instances)
* implement "recursive connect" for AWS credentials flie
* remove accounts for instances that have been terminated during AWS fetch
* be able to handle key references with no public key (e.g. when
  Amazon has a key fingerprint we don't recognize)

* automatically try sudo when we're 'root' or 'ubuntu' or 'ec2-user'


* should comment and names share the same namespace?

* Move SSH fetch to pure golang implementation (must work with OpenSSH agent)
* Make SSH fetch work with PLINK on Windows
* allow override of data repository location
* document commands

* handle key options in bindings
* remove keys from accounts via connections
* replace a key wherever it is
* deprecate a key wherever it is
* Do something with key aging

* Rotate SSH key in AWS

* import SSH keys from gitlab
* replace SSH keys in gitlab

* import SSH keys from github
* replace SSH keys in github

* import SSH keys from GCP
* replace SSH keys in GCP

* import SSH keys from DO
* replace SSH keys in DO

* generate AWS key for a given user
* remove given AWS key
* rotate given AWS key

* change key comment everywhere???

* Handle AWS accounts (not keys)???
* AWS key age/expiration
* parse the private key to generate the #$%#$%!@#$ Amazon fingerprint crap.  Must handle encrypted private keys.  Amazon has destroyed more productivity with this stupid decision than should be tolerated.

* parse multiple keys from a local file (e.g. known hosts)

DONE
* remove a key/connection/account/whatever
* AWS iterate over all regions
* verbose listing which shows keys for account (and accounts for key?)
* record flie name as key 'Name'
* record AWS name as key 'Name'
* display key names on listing
* display keys by account
* display accounts by key
* Import SSH keys from AWS
* import AWS keys from file
* report on instances using SSH key (can we build ssh access URLs?)
* import AWS keys from AWS account
