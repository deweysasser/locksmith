Status

THIS IS ALPHA CODE.

It's hot off of my fingers.  I'm using it in 2 environments but I
guarantee there are bugs.

The worst this code can do is zorch your authorized keys files on all
your servers.

That being said, please try it out and report bugs to dewey@sasser.com


Overview
========

Locksmith is designed to manage keys on remote servers for you.  It
will track what keys are on what servers, track the date where it
first saw a key, track expired keys, allow you to mark keys for
additions on some (or all) servers and update the servers in bulk.
