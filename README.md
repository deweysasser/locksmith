locksmith
=========

A tool for managing SSH keys on remote servers.

This code is currently a PROTOTYPE!  It's useful for me and I am
actively seeking feedback but I'm not willing to put it on the
"master" branch yet.

If you would like to try it out, a much more extensive Readme is
availabe on the "prototype" branch at
