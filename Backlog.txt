  servers added later.

* Allow un-enrolling (forgetting) a key
* automagically expand local hostname to fqdn
* define server sets on which to operate
* make domain an implicit set
* deal with servers that cannot be reached
* Perform server operations in parallel
* When listing keys, show on what servers they are in use
