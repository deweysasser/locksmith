Backlog of features

In priority order:

* Make "keys show <KEY>" filter correctly (might be a bug)
* Remember global (group?) key additions so that they can apply to
  servers added later.
* Do not add a key to the server if it already exists in the authorized_keys
* allow specification of servers by substring rather than exact match
* allow removing a key from a server without expiring it
* Allow un-enrolling (forgetting) a key
* automagically expand local hostname to fqdn
* define server sets on which to operate
* make domain an implicit set
* deal with servers that cannot be reached
* Perform server operations in parallel
* When listing keys, show on what servers they are in use
* use nmap to scan for hosts
  - have to deal with duplicate hosts somehow, yes?
* allow specification of username with e.g. -l flag
* Make sure we work with command= prefix specified authorized_keys lines
* Do some better date tracking on keys and server connection times
* Allow fetching on only servers which are outdated (e.g. we have no
  keys, but since a certain date would be nice, too).
* rewrite in python

Unordered:
* avoid use of ssh -- use only scp for greatest standardization
* Opportunistically harvest key origin dates from file modification dates.
* Implement "key replacement" to expire a key and substiatute a new
  key whenever the old one is found.
